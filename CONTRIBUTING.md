### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Tasks requiring assistance from an intermediate or advanced developer
- **qa-needed**: Tasks requiring assistance from users willing to perform quality assurance tests
- **documentation-needed**: Tasks requiring assistance from users willing to write the documentation
- **bug-high-priority**: Tasks requiring immediate assistance from an intermediate or advanced developer
- **bug-low-priority**: Tasks requiring assistance from a developer
- **help-wanted**: Tasks requiring assistance from any user willing to assist on the project

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
